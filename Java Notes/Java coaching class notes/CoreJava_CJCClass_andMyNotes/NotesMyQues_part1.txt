Collection framework learnings:-

File- Week 6 notes
1) What is collection framework? Why is it needed? 
2) Is Collection an interface? 
3) Classification of Collection interface in java
4) Difference between List and Set
5) What does < > indicate? 
6) 
List<Integer> list1= new ArrayList<>(); 
What are these methods used for?- add(), get()

7) Print the elements of list using Iterator, hasNext() and next()
Iterator<Integer> it= list1.iterator(); 
hasNext(), next()

8) Package of Iterator- java.util.Iterator

9) Create a custom class like Student. 
Make a list of objects of student and iterate over it using Iterator. 
Can you use next() of Iterator multiple times in same iteration? 
I made the following mistake->
In your while loop, you are calling the next() method three times in a single iteration, which means you are skipping over the second and third elements in the iterator.

10) Write a program to take user input for student class's objects and then add objects in list and iterate over it. 

11) List inside list. 
Example- Mahrashtra list- add cities like Pune, Mumbai; Gujarath list- add cities; 
then add above lists inside a list called India. 
Print all elements in list India.
