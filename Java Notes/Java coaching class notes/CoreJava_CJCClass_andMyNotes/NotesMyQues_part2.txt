Notes in the form of questions-> 
part2

1) Problems without Java generics, which exceptions were there

2) Without generics-
- Store elements in list of different data type and then store their values in respective data types. 
- Do you need typecasting for the above code?

3) List<String> list1= new ArrayList<>();
- Add elements in list. add() method
- Use forEach(), lambda expression, method reference, Iterator, for(dataType variable: ..) for looping.

4) Set
- What are the properties of Set?
- Set<Integer> set= new HashSet<>(); 
- add() method
- print the set elements

HashSet- remove duplicates
LinkedHashSet- remove duplicates and preserve insertion order
TreeSet- remove duplicates and sort elements.

5) Remove duplicate elements from list. 
- Write code using Set
- Write code for preserving order and without preserving order

6) How to sort list elements? 
- Collections.sort(arraylistName); 

7) Write code to remove duplicates and to sort elements in arraylist
- Use TreeSet

8)
- Difference in Comparable and Comparator interface

9) Sorting with Comparable
- class Student implements Comparable<Student>
Override compareTo() method

10) Sorting with Comparator
- Use Comparator to sort custom class's objects e.g. Student- sort as per rollno or sort as per method. 
- Sort in descending order
- 
Comparator<Student> crno= (o1, o2)-> o1.getRollno() - o2.getRollno();
Set<Student> set= new HashSet<>(crno);

11)
Map
- not a part of collection framework
- Classification of Map interface
- Properties of map
- If the key is duplicate, is at an error? and what will be the corresponding value?
- can Key be null?
- can value be null?
- Uses of Map

12)
- print all the key value pairs in map
- store all the keys in map inside a set using keySet() method. 
- loop over the keys and print the values in map.
- Write code using LinkedHashMap to preserve insertion order

13) TreeMap
- if key is null in TreeMap- NullPointerException
- For TreeMap without generocs, can you put heterogenous keys? Which exception? 

14) If Map is created using HashMap and key is null-> 
- printing values with Iterator- not an exception
- printing values with enhanced for loop- exception will be there.
